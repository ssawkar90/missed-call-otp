# Introduction #

Justification to user query, Why Open Source project is turned to an Open API Project?


# Details #

Hello,

Recently we have been receiving several queries / complains, asking about the risk associated with code released under mOTP Project.

Post Assessing the risk, The code repository was blocked and made unavailable to users ( We received couple of complaints, mentioning users exploiting the code, to use it for caller id spoofing purposes. )

Thus we have decided to avail the service via Open API, Which anyone could make use of to develop their own apps. This would also make sure, users wont be able to manipulate the code for malicious purposes.

We have put some downloadable source codes ( built on top of mOTP API ) , and are downloadable at http://code.google.com/p/missed-call-otp/w/list
